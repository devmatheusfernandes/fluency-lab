## Integration Points

### 1. Authentication Flow

- New users are automatically redirected to onboarding after signup
- Onboarding triggers when `session.user.role === 'STUDENT'` and `!session.user.tutorialCompleted`

### 2. Hub Layout Integration

- `OnboardingWrapper` component integrated into main hub layout
- Automatically shows onboarding modal for eligible users

### 3. Contract System Integration

- Uses existing `ContratoPDF` component for contract display
- Integrates with contract signing and logging system
- Updates user's `contractLengthMonths` field

### 4. Payment System Integration

- Connects to existing `SubscriptionService`
- Supports both PIX and Credit Card payment methods
- Creates subscriptions with proper contract duration

### 5. User Management Integration

- Updates user profile with onboarding completion status
- Sets `tutorialCompleted: true` after successful completion

## Usage

### For New Users

1. User signs up with `STUDENT` role
2. After authentication, hub layout detects incomplete onboarding
3. `OnboardingWrapper` shows the onboarding modal automatically
4. User completes all steps before accessing the platform

### For Developers

```tsx
import { OnboardingWrapper } from "@/components/onboarding";

// Wrap your main layout
<OnboardingWrapper>
  <YourMainContent />
</OnboardingWrapper>;
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables Required

```bash
# Mercado Pago Integration
MERCADO_PAGO_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_token
MERCADO_PAGO_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_secret
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Development Testing (optional)
DEV_TEST_API_KEY=dev-test-key-fluency-lab
```

### User Role Configuration

The onboarding system specifically targets users with:

- `role: 'STUDENT'` (regular students)
- `tutorialCompleted: false` or undefined

## Testing Checklist

### âœ… Manual Testing

- [ ] New user signup flow triggers onboarding
- [ ] All 9 steps navigate correctly
- [ ] Form validation works on all input fields
- [ ] Contract selection affects pricing display
- [ ] Contract signing creates proper database records
- [ ] PIX payment creates subscription correctly
- [ ] Credit card payment redirects to external URL
- [ ] Payment return flow marks onboarding complete
- [ ] Modal cannot be closed during critical steps
- [ ] Responsive design works on mobile/tablet
- [ ] Dark/light theme switching works
- [ ] Accessibility features (keyboard navigation, screen readers)

### âœ… API Testing

- [ ] POST `/api/onboarding/complete` updates user correctly
- [ ] POST `/api/onboarding/sign-contract` creates contract log
- [ ] POST `/api/onboarding/create-subscription` integrates with payment system
- [ ] GET `/api/auth/verification-status` returns correct status
- [ ] POST `/api/auth/resend-verification` sends email

### âœ… Integration Testing

- [ ] Session management works correctly
- [ ] User role detection functions properly
- [ ] Contract duration affects subscription creation
- [ ] Payment method selection creates correct subscription type
- [ ] Onboarding completion updates user session
- [ ] Navigation after completion works

### âœ… Error Handling

- [ ] Network errors are handled gracefully
- [ ] Form validation prevents invalid submissions
- [ ] API errors show appropriate user messages
- [ ] Payment failures are handled correctly
- [ ] Contract signing errors are caught
- [ ] Browser compatibility issues addressed

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Onboarding not showing**
   - Check user role is `STUDENT`
   - Verify `tutorialCompleted` is false/undefined
   - Check session authentication status

2. **Contract signing fails**
   - Verify all required fields are filled
   - Check CPF validation logic
   - Ensure user is 18+ years old

3. **Payment creation fails**
   - Check Mercado Pago credentials
   - Verify webhook URL is accessible
   - Check contract duration is 6 or 12 months

4. **Styling issues**
   - Import `onboarding.css` in main component
   - Check Tailwind CSS classes are available
   - Verify dark/light theme CSS variables

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

- [ ] Add animation between step transitions
- [ ] Implement step-specific progress persistence
- [ ] Add email verification integration
- [ ] Create onboarding analytics tracking
- [ ] Add multilingual support
- [ ] Implement onboarding customization by user type
- [ ] Add video tutorials for complex steps
- [ ] Create onboarding completion certificates

### Performance Optimizations

- [ ] Lazy load step components
- [ ] Implement step data caching
- [ ] Optimize image assets
- [ ] Add service worker for offline support

## Security Considerations

### Implemented Security Measures

- âœ… Server-side session validation
- âœ… CSRF protection via NextAuth
- âœ… Input sanitization and validation
- âœ… Secure contract signing with browser/IP tracking
- âœ… Payment processing through secure external providers
- âœ… Webhook signature verification

### Additional Recommendations

- [ ] Implement rate limiting on API endpoints
- [ ] Add audit logging for contract operations
- [ ] Monitor for suspicious onboarding patterns
- [ ] Implement session timeout during long onboarding
